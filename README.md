The system has 2 gates, entrance and exit gates, each gate has a sensor to indicate if a car is existing at the gate or not and a motor controlling opening/closing each gate. Plus a button that can be pressed by a human worker at the exit gate to let the gate open if the car on the exit gate has already payed its parking fees. The garage has 32 parking slots, each slot has 2 LEDs (one is green, indicating slot is free, and one is red, indicating slot is occupied). Garage also has a 2-digits 7-segment, that shows total number of free slots in the garage, that when the garage is tatally free segments should show '32' and when totally occupied segments should show '00'. The garage also has 2 LEDs next to the segments, one is green showing there's still free slots, and the other is red, indicating that garage is totally occupied.
